# 1. Introduction

<a name="sp1.1"></a>

## 1.1 Document Scope

This document defines the user requirements for the Italian Text Quality Analyzer project.

The system is designed to assist users in improving the quality of Italian texts by automatically detecting grammatical errors, repetitions, pleonasms, redundant expressions, and stylistic issues. The system also provides AI-assisted rewriting suggestions while preserving the original meaning of the text.

The requirements described in this document represent the expected behavior of the system from the user's perspective.

# 2. System Description

<a name="sp2.1"></a>

## 2.1 Context and Motivation

Writing high-quality texts often requires identifying grammatical mistakes, unnecessary repetitions, redundant phrases, and stylistic inconsistencies.

Many existing grammar checkers focus only on syntax correction and do not provide deeper linguistic analysis. The goal of this project is to create an integrated system capable of combining grammar correction, linguistic analysis, and AI-assisted rewriting for Italian texts.

The solution is accessible both through a REST API and directly from Google Docs.

## 2.2 Project Objectives

The objectives of the project are:

* Improve grammatical correctness of Italian texts.
* Detect lexical and semantic repetition.
* Detect and remove pleonastic expressions.
* Identify redundant sentences and repeated concepts.
* Generate improved text versions using AI.
* Preserve the original meaning of the text.
* Provide integration with Google Docs.
* Provide analysis reports explaining detected issues.
